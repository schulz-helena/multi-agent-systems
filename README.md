# multi-agent-systems
**Author: Helena Schulz**

This repository will contain the results of me playing around with multi-agent systems in python, inspired by a university course I attended.
For simulations, mesa will be used.

I plan on implementing different systems, starting with a map-based scenario focusing on task assignment, path finding and collision avoidance.
I will probably use different kinds of brokers for task assignment to begin with.
